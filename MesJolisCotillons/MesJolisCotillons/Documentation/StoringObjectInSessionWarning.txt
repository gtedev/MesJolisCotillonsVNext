Storing Object InSession Warning
===========================================================

If you store an object that encapsulates a repository, be careful because the context related to therepository will have a closed connection to database.

So if you reuse a repository that has been deserialized from Session, you will have an error.

For example if you have:

public class A {

	private Design_Repository repo = new Design_Repository();

}

if you do:

var  testA = new A ();
Session["A"] = testA;

Later if you retrieve:
var retrievedA = Session["A"];

=> variable "repo", will have a Context lost, connexion to database will be closed, due to fact that we will be certainly in anotger HttpContext.
